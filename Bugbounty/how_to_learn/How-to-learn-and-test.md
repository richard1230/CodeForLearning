https://twitter.com/rez0__/status/1557386150343544833

Three simple steps to learn hacking (or anything)

1. Look for content to learn (read: googling)
2. Consume it (read: reading blogs and watching videos)
3. Attempt it (read: do CTFs or just start hacking).

Repeat until successful.

Increase odds of success with accountability.
